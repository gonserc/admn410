	<h3> History
	</h3>
	<p>
	Welcome to Durham House of Pets located in the quaint town of Durham, New Hampshire. We are a family owned business that was founded in January 2000 by Jackson Marshall. When we first opened we were primarily focused on dogs since the founder, Jackson was a dog lover. Since then we have expanded into selling not only dog supplies, but cat and snake supplies as well. As our business grows we hope to start selling products to accommodate more pet owners. We are hoping that within the next three years we will begin to sell bird and fish supplies, along with fish as well

	<h3>Why Use Us?</h3>
	<p>
	While many pet owners tend to shop at larger branches such as Petco and Pet Smart, we encourage you to stop in to our storefront and learn more about our business and why you should shop with us. For starters, we always encourage supporting small businesses. We hope to continue expanding our stores and we canâ€™t do that without the help of our customers. The second you walk in to Durham House of Pets, our team will begin to cater to your needs and help you with anything you need. Not only do we go above and beyond to satisfy our customers, but we also offer a great location along with unbeatable prices.
